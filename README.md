[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/template/neo4j?referralCode=your-code)

Production-ready Neo4j 5.15.0 deployment optimized for Railway's infrastructure. Features memory-optimized settings (768MB total), APOC plugin, and one-click deployment.

## ✨ Features

- 🚀 **One-Click Deploy** - Deploy directly from GitHub to Railway
- 💾 **Memory Optimized** - 768MB total RAM (256MB Pagecache + 512MB Heap)
- 🔌 **APOC Plugin** - Pre-installed for advanced graph operations
- 🌐 **Both Protocols** - Bolt (7687) and HTTP (7474) enabled
- 🏥 **Health Check** - Automatic container monitoring
- ⚡ **Railway Ready** - Optimized for Railway Free/Hobby tier

## 🎯 Quick Deploy to Railway

### Option 1: One-Click Deploy (Easiest)

1. Click the "Deploy on Railway" button above
2. Set your password in the environment variables
3. Wait for deployment to complete
4. Access your Neo4j instance!

### Option 2: Deploy from CLI

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/MacStenk/neo4j-railway.git
cd neo4j-railway

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Initialize new project
railway init

# Set password (IMPORTANT!)
railway variables set NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/your-secure-password

# Deploy
railway up

# Monitor logs
railway logs --follow
```

### Option 3: Connect Existing Railway Project

```bash
# In Railway Dashboard
1. Go to your project
2. Click "New Service"
3. Choose "GitHub Repo"
4. Select "MacStenk/neo4j-railway"
5. Set NEO4J_AUTH variable
6. Deploy
```

## 🔐 Security Configuration

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Change the default password immediately!

Set the `NEO4J_AUTH` environment variable in Railway:

```
NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/your-secure-password
```

Minimum password length: 8 characters

## 💾 Data Persistence (CRITICAL!)

**⚠️ WITHOUT A VOLUME, ALL DATA IS LOST ON REDEPLOY!**

### Add Volume After First Deployment:

1. Go to Railway Dashboard → Your Service
2. **Settings → Volumes**
3. Click **"+ New Volume"**
4. Configure:
   - Name: `neo4j-data`
   - Mount Path: `/data`
   - Size: 1GB (minimum)
5. Click **"Add"**
6. Service will automatically redeploy

**Detailed Guide:** See [VOLUME_SETUP.md](VOLUME_SETUP.md)

**Cost:** ~$0.25/GB/month

## 🌐 Connecting to Neo4j

After deployment, Railway provides two connection methods:

### HTTP Browser (Neo4j Browser)

```
URL: https://your-app.railway.app
Username: neo4j
Password: your-secure-password
```

### Bolt Protocol (For applications)

```
URL: bolt://proxy-domain.railway.app:PORT
Username: neo4j
Password: your-secure-password
```

**Note:** Use `bolt://` (not `bolt+s://`) for Railway TCP Proxy connections.

## 📊 Memory Configuration

Default settings (total ~768MB):

| Setting | Value | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Pagecache | 256MB | File system cache |
| Heap Max | 512MB | Maximum JVM heap |
| Heap Initial | 256MB | Initial JVM heap |

### Adjust Memory (if needed)

For Railway Trial (512MB RAM):
```bash
railway variables set NEO4J_server_memory_pagecache_size=128M
railway variables set NEO4J_dbms_memory_heap_max__size=384M
railway variables set NEO4J_dbms_memory_heap_initial__size=128M
```

For Railway Hobby (1GB+ RAM):
```bash
railway variables set NEO4J_server_memory_pagecache_size=512M
railway variables set NEO4J_dbms_memory_heap_max__size=1G
railway variables set NEO4J_dbms_memory_heap_initial__size=512M
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

All configuration is done through Railway environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `NEO4J_AUTH` | `neo4j/changeme123` | Username/password (CHANGE THIS!) |
| `NEO4J_server_memory_pagecache_size` | `256M` | Pagecache size |
| `NEO4J_dbms_memory_heap_max__size` | `512M` | Max heap size |
| `NEO4J_dbms_memory_heap_initial__size` | `256M` | Initial heap size |

### Ports

- **7474** - HTTP (Neo4j Browser)
- **7687** - Bolt Protocol

Railway automatically exposes these ports via:
- Public domain for port 7474
- TCP Proxy for port 7687

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Container crashes immediately

**Cause:** Not enough RAM available

**Solution:**
```bash
# Reduce memory settings
railway variables set NEO4J_server_memory_pagecache_size=128M
railway variables set NEO4J_dbms_memory_heap_max__size=384M
railway redeploy
```

### Can't connect via Bolt

**Cause:** Using wrong protocol or port

**Solution:**
- Use `bolt://` (not `bolt+s://`)
- Use Railway's TCP Proxy address (find in Dashboard → Networking)
- Test connection: `nc -zv proxy-address PORT`

### "Database access might require an authenticated connection"

**Cause:** Wrong password or Neo4j not fully started

**Solution:**
- Check password in Railway variables
- Wait 30-60 seconds after deployment
- Check logs: `railway logs`

### Health check failing

**Cause:** Neo4j not responding on time

**Solution:**
- Check container has enough resources
- View logs for startup errors
- Health check retries automatically

## 🧪 Testing Your Installation

After deployment, test with these Cypher queries:

```cypher
// Create a test node
CREATE (n:TestNode {name: 'Hello Railway', timestamp: timestamp()}) 
RETURN n;

// Test APOC
CALL apoc.help("apoc.create");

// Check database status
CALL dbms.components();
```
